## Installation

This package is distributed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webstronauts/laravel-scripts) which is bundled with [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev @webstronauts/laravel-scripts
```

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `laravel-scripts`. We don't really plan on documenting or testing it very well because it's really specific to our custom [Laravel boilerplate](https://github.com/webstronauts/laravel-liftoff). You'll find all available scripts in `lib/scripts`.

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode. It will recompile all assets when any changes are detected.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the public folder. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
